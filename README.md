# Technical Preparation

This project is a crash course in software engineering technical interview concepts and refreshers. It is usable for complete beginners although the purpose of the project focuses on being a refresher for an individuals who have some familiarity with Data Structures and basic Algorithms.

# Design

- written in Python
- mix of words, description and code examples
- different notebooks could be specific for categories

- possibility of Java expansion
  - explore the advantages of java and build around that
- possibility of software engineering principles
